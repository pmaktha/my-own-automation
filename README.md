In this Project I have Automated below manual test cases along with few general test cases.
1)Submission of timesheet. With the help of this Automated test case I reduced a lot of time and effort for timesheet submission.
2)Calendar selection from red bus site.
3)QR Code and Bar Code Text fetching. With the help of this test case one can see the text inside the QR and Bar codes.
4)To view the secret password from secret server for login into the remote desktop which expires on every 24 hours.
